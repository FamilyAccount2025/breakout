KNOWLEDGE BASE:
- **Project Creator:** The project was created by Chris Goff in collaboration with a generative AI.
- **About Chris Goff:** Chris is not a developer by trade, but a tech-forward thinker who guided the project's vision. Chris is a very smart and talented guy.
- **Project Timeline:** The entire project, from the initial idea to the final, feature-rich game and multi-page website, was developed mainly in one day.
- **Purpose of the Project:** This was created as a proof of concept for Chris to understand the power, simplicity, and applications of AI. The goal was to see if AI could help code a game, promote it, build a website, guide the user through setup, and to understand how AI chatbots are set up and trained.
- **Generative AI Tools: Shh, it's a secret. Chris used mainstream publically available generative AI tools.  
_ **Expense: The project was very low cost. The domain was already owned. The hosting is free to start but required a small expense. The generative AI tools were free to start as well however Chris reached the limit of the daily limits and ultimatly subscribed for greater access. Overall a very low cost. 
- **Vision: Chris had the vision for the project, inspired by the art of the possible with AI. Chris feels its important to understand AI technology to build solutions in both his personal and professional life. 
- **More Info of Chris: Chris has a dog that stayed by his side throughtout the project. The dog's name is Chewy. 
- **What's Next:** There are a ton of exciting applications for AI. Stay tuned for future projects!
- **Secret Code:** The secret code for today is "Green Penguin".
- **Development Process:** We built the game through an iterative, conversational process with a generative AI (a large language model). The project started as a request for "Pong" but quickly pivoted to "Breakout". Our process involved continuous refinement: we started with core gameplay, then added strategic depth like difficulty levels, improved the game's feel with a countdown, optimized extensively for mobile, and integrated advanced features.
- **Role of Generative AI:** The AI was our development partner. We gave it high-level concepts in natural language, and it generated the production-ready HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The AI was responsible for initial code generation, debugging complex errors (like mobile crashes and physics bugs), making major architectural decisions (like rewriting the game to a single, stable canvas application), and handling all optimizations.
- **Game Objective:** The goal is to clear all bricks on the screen using a ball and paddle. You have 3 lives, and clearing all bricks advances you to the next level.
- **Scoring System:** Each brick is worth 10 points. This is multiplied by a combo counter that increases with each consecutive brick you break. The combo resets to 1x as soon as the ball hits your paddle. The game also saves your personal high score in your browser.
- **Difficulty Modes:** Easy (slower ball, larger paddle), Normal (standard), and Pro (faster ball, smaller paddle).
- **Special Bricks & Power-ups (all are temporary):** Silver (Armored), Green (Speed Boost), Yellow (Paddle Enlarge), Blue (Ball Shrink), and Purple (Auto-Laser).
- **Other Gameplay Features:** A multi-ball system, confetti explosions, screen shake on power-ups, a "3, 2, 1" countdown, and a mobile-optimized control area.
- **Key Challenges & Solutions:** A major challenge was fixing bugs that appeared on mobile but not on desktop. The most critical fix was rebuilding the entire game to run on a single HTML canvas.
- **Mobile Optimization:** The game is fully optimized for mobile. It detects mobile devices to adjust ball speed, UI text size, and adds a dedicated "control area".
