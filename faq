                        <p>The Breakout game was developed through an iterative, conversational process, initially pivoting from a request for "Pong" to "Breakout." This highlights a flexible development method where a large language model (LLM) acted as an AI development partner. The process involved continuous refinement, starting with core gameplay, adding strategic depth (difficulty levels), improving game feel (countdown), optimizing for mobile, and integrating advanced features like multi-ball and power-ups. This approach demonstrates how generative AI can accelerate the transformation of an idea into a tangible, interactive product through natural language requests and continuous iteration.</p>

                        <p>Generative AI, specifically a large language model, played the role of an AI development partner. It translated natural language requests into production-ready HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The AI was responsible for code generation based on high-level concepts, debugging and refinement by analyzing error messages and re-generating corrected code, making senior-level architectural decisions (like rewriting the game to a canvas-based application for stability), and handling optimization for both desktop and mobile platforms. This showcases the AI's ability to manage complex development tasks through conversational prompts.</p>

                        <p>The objective of the game is to clear all bricks on the screen by hitting them with a ball. Players have 3 lives, and clearing all bricks advances them to the next level. Scoring is based on 10 points per brick, with a combo multiplier that increases for each consecutive brick broken, resetting when the ball hits the paddle. The game saves the highest score in the browser and features progressive levels with unique brick layouts that loop once completed.</p>

These problems were addressed by re-engineering and optimizing the code, often from scratch, to ensure stability. A significant architectural decision made by the AI was to rewrite the game into a single, canvas-based application, which is a standard professional game development pattern that solved numerous UI-related bugs.</p>

Additionally, the AI implemented a `deltaTime`-based game loop to ensure consistent game speed across different devices, contributing to a smoother mobile experience.</p>
